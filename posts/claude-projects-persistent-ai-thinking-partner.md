## The Experiment

I wanted to test whether Claude's Projects feature could actually serve as a persistent thinking partner for complex, multi-week projects. The promise: AI that remembers context, maintains custom instructions, and evolves with your work over time.

## What I Tested

Over three weeks, I used Claude Projects to:

- Plan and outline a research paper
- Iterate on ideas across multiple sessions
- Maintain custom writing style preferences
- Track evolving thoughts and decisions

## What Worked

**Context Persistence**: Unlike regular chat sessions, Projects actually remembered previous conversations. I could reference decisions made days ago without re-explaining everything.

**Custom Instructions**: Setting up project-specific guidelines (tone, format preferences, domain knowledge) meant Claude adapted its responses automatically.

**Knowledge Base**: Uploading relevant documents created a shared reference library. Claude could pull from these materials without me having to paste content repeatedly.

## What Didn't Work

**Limited File Types**: Only accepts text-based files. Wanted to upload spreadsheets and presentations but had to convert everything to PDF or plain text first.

**No Organization**: With multiple conversations in one project, finding specific discussions became difficult. No folders or tags within projects.

**Context Limits**: After extensive back-and-forth, Claude occasionally "forgot" earlier context despite being in a Project. Not sure if this is a token limit or something else.

## The Verdict

**Good for**: Long-term creative projects, research with evolving ideas, maintaining consistent tone/style across multiple writing sessions.

**Skip if**: You need structured file organization, work with non-text formats, or expect truly unlimited context memory.

## What You Should Know

1. **Set up custom instructions carefully** - These persist across all conversations in the project, so take time to define what you need upfront
2. **Name conversations clearly** - You'll thank yourself later when searching for that specific discussion
3. **Save important outputs externally** - Don't rely on Projects as your only backup
4. **Works best for iterative thinking** - Ideal for projects that evolve over time rather than one-off tasks

## Bottom Line

Claude Projects transformed how I use AI for complex work. Instead of starting from scratch each time, I have a thinking partner that actually remembers our conversation. It's not perfect—organization needs work and context limits exist—but for sustained creative and analytical work, it's the closest I've found to AI that truly "gets" ongoing projects.

**Would I use it again?** Absolutely. Already planning my next long-form project with it.
