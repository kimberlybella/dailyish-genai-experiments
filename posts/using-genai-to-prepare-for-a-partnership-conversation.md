This week’s experiment explored how GenAI can speed up and elevate partnership preparation, not just by summarizing a company’s data, but by helping you think like their business.

I wanted to approach a potential partner conversation with real context, understanding how they make money, what their recent acquisitions reveal about their strategy, and how their tech roadmap connects to emerging data opportunities.

In under an hour, both ChatGPT and Perplexity produced what felt like mini-consulting reports: business model, revenue streams, client pain points, and smart conversation prompts. 

Did Perplexity spend an entire paragraph in the executive summary explaining how it determined that the company I asked about, was in fact, the company I wanted it to analyze? It sure did, and while completely unnecessary, the logic was sound.

That interesting choice aside, both tools helped me reframe the meeting itself, from an intro chat to a strategic exchange about shared growth opportunities.

Instead of asking what do you do? the conversation shifted to:

“How can we collectively create more value for clients, faster, and more responsibly?”
That shift turned a routine partnership meeting into a co-design session.

I also popped the highlights of the analysis into Gamma to spin up an aesthetically pleasing conversation guide to help keep the discussion on track.

💡 Takeaway: GenAI doesn’t replace preparation; it amplifies it. When you use it to see the world through your partner’s eyes, every conversation becomes a chance to explore what’s possible together.

Meta-Experiment: Enhancing the Experiment

Iteratively refining this post, including text and visuals, became its own GenAI experiment. Each round of collaboration turned insight into design, and design into a reusable framework.

💡Lesson: GenAI isn’t just a writing partner. It’s a co-designer in clarity, tone, and impact.
