## The Experiment

Can AI help plan a party based on specific media? I tested this by planning my child's birthday party themed around the Netflix movie K-Pop Demon Hunters.

Plot twist: Claude didn't know about the movie (not in its training data which cuts off in January 2025), so it worked purely from the concept I described—"K-pop meets demon hunting." Would generic theme ideas still work for a party based on specific media?

## The Process

## Starting Point
One simple prompt: "K-pop demon hunters themed party - what are some party ideas?"

## The Journey (30 minutes across 3 conversations)

## Conversation 1: Foundation

Theme exploration (decorations, activities, food)
Guest list and 4-week timeline

## Conversation 2: Deep Dive

10+ game concepts
Scavenger hunt mechanics (individual vs. team)
Three "Pin the" game variations
Prize budget breakdown

## Conversation 3: Food & Beverage

Themed snacks with creative names
Korean-inspired options

## What Claude Created:

Complete 4-week planning timeline with tasks
10+ unique game concepts blending K-pop and demon hunting
Detailed activity stations with setup checklists
Themed menu ("Power-up Potions," "Demon Defeating Dumplings")
Prize distribution strategy
Music playlist suggestions

## Techniques That Worked

## Be Specific When It Matters

❌ "What games should I have?"
✅ "K-pop demon hunter games for individual play?"

## Build Incrementally

Tackle one category at a time rather than asking for everything at once.

## Use Voice for Brainstorming, Text for Structure

Voice chat works great for ideation, but switch to text when you need document updates or detailed outputs.

## The Results

## What Surprised Me:
Generic ideas still worked - Even without knowing the movie, Claude created cohesive K-pop + demon hunting concepts
Practical details included - Not just ideas, but checklists, timing, and setup notes
Budget-conscious - Helped work within constraints rather than suggesting expensive options

## Limitations:

No specific references - Couldn't suggest ideas based on actual characters or scenes from the movie
Voice-to-artifact gaps - Couldn't update documents during voice conversations
Generic approach - All suggestions were conceptual, not tied to specific movie elements kids would recognize

## The Verdict: 8/10
AI excelled at:

Generating creative ideas quickly
Organizing information systematically
Remembering context across conversations
Working productively despite knowledge gaps

Could improve:

Movie-specific references (knowledge limitation)
Proactive suggestions for next steps
Quantity estimates (had to prompt for this)

## The Knowledge Gap Insight:

Claude's lack of movie knowledge didn't prevent usefulness, it just meant planning was concept-based rather than specific to the film. For media-based parties, you'll need to add character names, iconic scenes, and recognizable moments yourself.

## Alternative Approach - Using Perplexity:

For movie-specific details, use Perplexity alongside Claude:

Perplexity: Research character names, key scenes, visual style from K-Pop Demon Hunters
Claude: Organize info into party plans, create checklists, manage budget
Best of both: Facts from Perplexity + planning from Claude = complete party with specific references

## Try It Yourself!

## Experiment Ideas:

## Beginner:

Plan one aspect of your next event (menu, activities, or timeline)
Combine two unrelated themes and see what AI creates
Give AI a budget constraint and see how creative it gets

## Intermediate:

Plan the same event for different age groups and compare
Blend traditions from different cultures
Test how well context persists across multiple conversations

## Advanced:

Use Perplexity to gather facts, then Claude to organize them into a plan
Ask AI to plan from different perspectives (budget-conscious vs. luxury)
Deliberately give conflicting requirements and observe trade-offs

## Starter Prompts:

## For Party Planning:

"I'm planning a [age] birthday with a [theme] theme. What are some activity ideas?"
"Help me create a timeline for [event] happening in [timeframe]"
"I have [budget] for [category]. How should I allocate it?"

## For Creative Projects:

"Combine [concept A] and [concept B] - brainstorm ideas"
"Develop this basic idea into a complete plan: [your idea]"
"Give me [number] variations on [concept] for [audience]"

## Pro Tips:
Start broad, then narrow - Let AI brainstorm first, then add constraints
Request specific formats - Ask for checklists, timelines, or budgets when you need structure
Mix tools strategically - Research tools for facts, planning tools for organization
Save effective prompts - Note what works well for future use

## The Bigger Picture

AI isn't just for coding or writing—it's surprisingly effective for creative project planning. The key is treating it as a collaborative brainstorming partner, not a magic solution.

The lesson: Even with knowledge gaps, AI provided useful scaffolding and creative direction. For media-based projects, AI gives you the framework; you add the specific details fans care about.

This made party planning actually fun instead of overwhelming. Now I just need all of the K-pop demon hunter decorations to arrive in time... 🎤👻

Your Turn: What could you plan with AI this week?

Time Investment: ~30 minutes across 3 conversations Usefulness: High - Complete, actionable party plan Fun Factor: Unexpectedly high
