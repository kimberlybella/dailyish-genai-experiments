How I Used Them

After my initial Claude brain dump on talking to executives about AI adoption (see Claude Projects: Foundation Thought Partnership - https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/claude-projects-foundation-thought-partnership-kimberly-bella-f81le), I ran the same exercise through both Gemini and ChatGPT. 

Similar to how I might approach discussing concepts with a focus group or in a brainstorming session, I wasn't looking for the "best" output, I was looking for diversity of perspective and to learn more about how each tool considers the challenge. 

Each tool approached my presentation structure differently. I extracted the elements that resonated across all three platforms and used those insights to build a stronger first draft than any single tool could have produced alone.

Key Learnings

No single AI tool has a monopoly on good ideas. Each platform's different training and architecture led to genuinely different structural suggestions. Claude might suggest one narrative flow, while ChatGPT proposed a different angle, and Gemini offered yet another perspective.
The best ideas survive cross-platform comparison. When all three tools suggested similar approaches for certain sections, I knew I was onto something strong. When they diverged, it flagged areas where I needed to make intentional creative choices.
This isn't inefficient, it's insurance. Yes, using three tools takes more time upfront. But it prevents you from going too far down a path that only works in one AI's worldview. You're stress-testing your ideas before you even start drafting.

The meta lesson: I didn't trust just one AI to structure my presentation about AI adoption. Why would you? For your next important project or even if you're planning a kid's birthday party, give yourself permission to 'waste' 20 minutes comparing outputs. The strongest ideas reveal themselves immediately. The weak ones get filtered out before you build on them. Call it insurance, call it due diligence, just don't call it inefficient until you've tried it.
